Do a model comparasion using LR test
H0: the coefficient of quadratic term of Temp = 0
Ha: the coefficient of quadratic term of Temp != 0
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(car)
challenger <- read.csv("Challenger.csv")
fit.1 <- glm(O.ring/Number ~ Temp, weight = Number, family = binomial(link = "logit"),data = challenger)
fit.2 <- glm(O.ring/Number ~ Temp + I(Temp^2), weights = Number, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = challenger)
anova(fit.2, fit.1, test = "LR")
```
Based on p-value > 0.05, we cannot reject H0. So we accept that the quadratic term of Temp is not needed in our model.
