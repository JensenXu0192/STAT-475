Run a LR model comparasion test
H0 : beta_1 = 0
Ha: beta_1 != 0
```{r}
wrk <- read.csv('healthcare_worker.csv')
library(dplyr)
library(car)
wrk.fit <- glm(Hepatitis/Size ~ Occup.group, weights = Size, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = wrk)
Anova(wrk.fit, test = "LR")
data.frame(ORs = exp(wrk.fit$coefficients[-1]), Contact = c("Fluid", "Lab", "Non - patient Contact", "Patient contact"))
```

The test statistic yields to do not reject H0, so we accept that occupational groups have no effect on hepatitis.
From the ORs we see the odds of being hepatitis positive in the non-patient contact category is 2.82 times as high as the baseline level(exposure prone), which is the highest, and this is the opposite of my expectation..
