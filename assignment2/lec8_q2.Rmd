## Exercise 2

(a)
```{r}
library(dplyr)
placekick <- read.csv("U:/stat475/assignment2/Placekick.csv")
placekick <- mutate(placekick, week = as.factor(week), change = as.factor(change), PAT = as.factor(PAT), type = as.factor(type), field = as.factor(field), wind = as.factor(wind))
k.fit <- glm(good ~ ., family = binomial(link = logit), data = placekick)
summary(k.fit)
```

(b)
```{r}
library(car)
k.fit2 <- glm(good ~ distance, family = binomial(link = logit), data = placekick)
anova(k.fit, k.fit2, test = "LR")
```
From the result, we can drop all of the rest variables.


(c)
```{r}
Anova(k.fit)
```
Distance and PAT seem to contribute significantly to the model fit.
i. We cannot conclude to use only the 2 variables, because in our model we haven't tested any interaction effects.
