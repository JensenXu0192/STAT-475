## Exercise 2 (a)

```{r}
est.mu <- 225
n <- 1
alpha = 0.05
## Exact CI
qchisq(p = c(alpha/2, 1 - alpha/2), df = c(2*n*est.mu, 2*(n*est.mu + 1)))/(2*n)->CI
round(CI,2)
```
We expect 95% of all similarly constructed intervals with range [196.56, 256.40] to contain the mean count of cars crossing this bridge at this time period.
